== Git Experiments

This is a repo where I try a few technologies related to managing projects by maintaining files within the repo.

Technologies used in this repo:

=== https://github.com/npryce/pottery[Pottery]

Install pottery, then run `pottery show` to see sherds.

=== https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools[ADR-Tools]

ADRs are in the docs folder.
